##### QUESTION 3 - https://codesignal.com/blog/engineering/example-codesignal-questions/ 
### Your task is to find the dropping position such that at least one full row is formed. 
# As a dropping position you should consider the column index of the cell in game field which matches the top left corner of the figure 3 Ã— 3 matrix. 
# 
# If there are multiple dropping positions satisfying the condition, feel free to return any of them. If there are no such dropping positions, return -1.

   height = len(field)

   figure_size = len(figure)
 
   for column in range(width - figure_size + 1):
